# CAS Data Science - Machine Learning slides

| WARNING: Slides are still work in progress, as they will be used the first time in HS22. |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

This repository contains my slides for the "Machine Learning" subject at CAS Data Science.

## Slides

The current slides are hosted on github pages: <a href="https://benikm91.github.io/cas_machine-learning-slides" target="_blank">https://benikm91.github.io/cas_machine-learning-slides</a>

## Technology

### Illustrations

Most illustrations used in the slides are hand-made to make them consistent throughout the slides. They are created in Jupyter Notebooks in the code-examples/plots folder.

### Reveal.js

I use reveal.js mixed with Angular for the slides. Why not use Power Point? Because programming is way more fun :)

## Development

### Install

Run `npm i` to install all packages.

### Serve

Run `npm run serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
